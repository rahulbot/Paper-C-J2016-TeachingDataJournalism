	abstract = {This study was designed to investigate 19preservice and practicing teachers' conceptions of the role of new technologies in literacy education. The study documented how these conceptions, as well as my own, evolved over time and impacted the content and curriculum of a university course. Using a design-based research model, I documented students' engagement in a semesterlong teacher education course titled Literacy and Technology. Relying on multiple data sources, including digitally recorded classroom conversations, one-on-one teacher and student meetings, student surveys, classroom artifacts (e.g., online threaded discussions, written responses to readings, and journal entries), and my own reflective notes, I documented classroom conversations, analyzed written assignments, and discovered how participants' conceptions of literacy and technology frequently differed from my own. Throughout the semester, I developed new conceptions of teaching when I saw that my students responded to course assignments and activities in ways that I had not anticipated. The study raises questions about the role of the instructor and the purposes and goals of courses like Literacy and Technology. It also points to a number of areas that need to be further explored if teacher educators hope to effectively introduce teachers to the ways in which technology can support literacy learning.},

In this book the authors offer both design specifications for a learner-centered approach to curriculum as well as practical recommendations for implementation and assessment. The book covers the need for redesigning curriculum, curriculum design in the instructional paradigm, learner-centered design in practice, implementation, program assessment (including a helpful rubric for this), innovating through technology, and learning spaces that support learner-centered curricula."--Provided by publisher.},

Yet as algorithms come to regulate more aspects of our lives, the contours of their power can remain difficult to grasp. This paper studies the notion of algorithmic accountability reporting as a mechanism for elucidating and articulating the power structures, biases, and influences that computational artifacts exercise in society. A framework for algorithmic power based on autonomous decision-making is proffered and motivates specific questions about algorithmic influence. Five cases of algorithmic accountability reporting involving the use of reverse engineering methods in journalism are then studied and analyzed to provide insight into the method and its application in a journalism context. The applicability of transparency policies for algorithms is discussed alongside challenges to implementing algorithmic accountability as a broadly viable investigative method.},

It presents a specific example of the complexity of users' considerations affecting their possible acceptance of innovations.

Design for user acceptance is a process that cannot be adequately addressed through the perspective of the design engineer alone; detailed understanding of the potential users' perspectives, their concerns, their operational constraints, and the practicalities of operational use and their perceived need for the innovation are essential. In addition, users should be made aware that their considerations are being taken into account, and they should be made aware of the capabilities and limitations of the new technology, and other constraints on design, which necessarily influence what can be practically achieved. Preparing and executing a systematic innovation acceptance plan during system development would ultimately result in demonstration of an operationally compatible device to users who are informed and involved, a result that is essential if user acceptance is to be insured.},

However, its most common applications in undergraduate education (such as videotaped lectures) have been disappointing in terms of the quality of education they provide; and more innovative, computer-based applications have been deemed costly. Educators at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute have developed a new interactive, multimedia model called the “Studio” that replaces the traditional lecture/recitation/lab format with a single Studio classroom of 48–64 students. Student performance and satisfaction are high, and total cost is lower than in the traditional model. The Studio is the core of an ambitious set of interactive, collaborative, multimedia, and distance learning techniques at Rensselaer which are attracting widespread interest among educators nationally and internationally.},

	abstract = {Background: Suboptimal breastfeeding results in 800 000 child deaths annually. There are multiple causes of suboptimal breastfeeding, including marketing of breast-milk substitutes.
Objectives: To describe sales and marketing of breast-milk substitutes and their influence on World Health Organization-recommended breastfeeding behaviors, focusing on low- and middle-income countries.
Methods: Literature review.
Results: Global sales of breast-milk substitutes reached {US}\$40 billion in 2013. Growth in sales exceeds 10\% annually in many low- and middle-income countries, while it is close to stagnant in high-income countries. Breast-milk substitutes are marketed directly to consumers via mass media and print advertisements and indirectly via incentives, free supplies, and promotions to and through health workers and facilities, retailers, and policy makers. Internet marketing via company web sites and social media is on the rise. Marketing influences social norms by making formula use seem to be extensive, modern, and comparable to or better than breast milk. Clear evidence of a negative impact is found when breast-milk substitutes are provided for free in maternity facilities and when they are promoted by health workers and in the media. Influences through other channels are plausible, but rigorous studies are lacking. It was not possible with the data available to quantify the impact of marketing relative to other factors on suboptimal breastfeeding behaviors. Marketing remains widespread even in countries that have adopted the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes to restrict such activities.
Conclusion: Adoption of stricter regulatory frameworks coupled with independent, quantitative monitoring and compliance enforcement are needed to counter the impacts of formula marketing globally.},

	abstract = {This review examines the literature addressing the concept of peer tutoring. Journal articles and education documents written within the last 10 years that discussed peer tutoring were considered. The evidence reviewed overwhelmingly supported the use of peer tutoring and discussed it as an effective instructional strategy. The key points that were proclaimed by peer tutoring advocates were enhanced academic and social benefits to students with and without disabilities. Advocates also encouraged the use of peer tutoring to help meet the educational needs of students with and without disabilities. However, educators interested in implementing peer tutoring practices should make certain that students are properly trained in both roles, the tutor and the tutee roles. (Contains 25 references.)

	abstract = {Effective integration of Information and Communication Technology ({ICT}) into teaching and learning is becoming an essential competency for teachers. However, teachers do not usually follow linear instructional design models when they are planning for {ICT} integration. This paper proposes a generic model, which consists of three fundamental elements: pedagogy, social interaction and technology. Sound design of these components should help teachers to integrate {ICT} into their curricula in effective ways. Constructivist learning theories, the design of interactivity and the notion of usefulness provide the theoretical foundations for the construction of this model. Some examples of applying this model to the design of Web‐based learning environments, facilitation of online discussions and comparison of {ICT} tools are presented.},
